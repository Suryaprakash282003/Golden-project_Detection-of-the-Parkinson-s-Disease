# Golden-project_Detection-of-the-Parkinson-s-Disease

The dataset employed for this project is derived from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityakadiwal/parkinsons-disease-detection/notebook. It encompasses details such as:

The goal of a Parkinson's disease detection system is to create an accurate model for early diagnosis. Early detection enables timely intervention, personalized patient care, and supports research and drug development. It can reduce healthcare costs, enhance the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's, and facilitate patient education. Ethical considerations, patient privacy, and collaboration between data scientists and healthcare professionals are essential in the development and deployment of such models.

## Methodology
Obtain a comprehensive dataset containing relevant information for individuals, including features such as voice recordings, demographic details, and clinical attributes. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative of the population under consideration.

## Data Cleaning
Address missing values: Impute or remove missing data to ensure a complete dataset.
Handle outliers: Identify and handle outliers that may affect the model's performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the distribution of features.
Visualize data patterns and relationships.
Analyze correlations between different features

## Feature Engineering
Enhance the dataset by creating new features, transforming existing ones, or extracting relevant information. Consider feature engineering techniques specific to Parkinson's disease characteristics.

## Feature Scaling
Apply feature scaling methods, such as normalization, to ensure that features are on a similar scale. This is crucial for certain machine learning algorithms.

## Data Imbalance
Address any class imbalance issues in the dataset. Parkinson's disease datasets may have an imbalance between individuals with and without Parkinson's. Use techniques like oversampling (creating synthetic samples) or undersampling to balance the classes.

## Preprocessing Function
Create a dedicated Python function, e.g., parkinson_prep(dataframe), to streamline preprocessing steps. This function should handle all preprocessing tasks, ensuring consistency between the training and testing datasets.

## Models Training
Train the selected model using the training dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate the Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model to the training data
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
